In order for this package to run we need to setup a couple of things. All of this is tested with NVIDIA geforce gtx 1050 ti

1. Download the darknet_ros package from this link https://github.com/leggedrobotics/darknet_ros. Important to follow the installation guide in README.

2. Download training weights using git lfs. git lfs install and then git lfs pull

3. In order to utilize the GPU when running the network a few things have to be set.
    - in Terminal "nvcc --version" and check if ncvv is installed. This is dependent on g++ version you have installed. 
    With g++ 9 installed you would need nvcc version >= 11

    - If not is installed, install the correct version from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=20.04&target_type=runfile_local
        Important here is to download the runfile-version of the toolkit. You may also need to download a supported driver with this one.
        After the toolkit is installed, check the folder /usr/local/ if it containt the folder cuda-11.7
        If it does add the following two lines to ~/.bashrc and source it:
        
            export PATH="/usr/local/cuda-11.7/bin:$PATH"
            export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda-11.7/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

        Check now if "nvcc --version" is installed and shows version 11.7.

4. Due to dep. in CUDA we need to remove a couple of supported architectures from the darknet_ros' CMakeLists.txt.
    - comment out line 26 and 27 containing the following:

        -gencode arch=compute_30,code=sm_30
        -gencode arch=compute_35,code=sm_35

5. catkin_make and source and hopefully be happy with the result :)
